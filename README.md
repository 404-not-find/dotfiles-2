I use [Vim/Neovim](vim/vimrc), [git](.config/git/config), [zsh](zsh/.zshrc) and
[tmux](.tmux.conf) on a daily base and thus these configs are the most
customized. Have fun reading them and steal what you need.

P.S. My personal assistent was [outsourced](https://github.com/mhinz/mhi).

*Disclaimer: No Reddit users were hurt during the creation of these
configuration files.*
