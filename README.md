My dotfiles.

I use [Vim/Neovim](vim/vimrc), [git](.config/git/config), [zsh](zsh/.zshrc) and
[tmux](.tmux.conf) on a daily base and thus these configs are the most
customized.

Have fun reading them and steal what you need.

If I missed any community-approved idoms or something is out-of-date, kindly
create an issue for it.

*Disclaimer: No Reddit users were hurt during the creation of these
configuration files.*
