A few years ago I switched from Linux to macOS, but my workflow didn't change a
lot. I just need a browser and a terminal emulator. The majority of my work is
done in a shell with a handful of tools.

Everyday, I use [Nvim](.vim/vimrc), [git](.config/git/config),
[tmux](.tmux.conf), and [zsh](.zsh/.zshrc) ([profile](.profile), [shrc](.shrc))
and thus these config files are the most customized.

Have fun reading them and steal what you need.

_Disclaimer: No Reddit users were hurt during the creation of these
configuration files._
